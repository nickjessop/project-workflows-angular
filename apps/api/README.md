# API Project

This project is not yet currently in use and is still being built.

The frontend Stepflow app currently hits Firebase directly and any relevant Firebase Cloud Functions that are there instead of going through a backend api layer.

The purpose of this project is to be the layer between Stepflow frontend and Firebase.
